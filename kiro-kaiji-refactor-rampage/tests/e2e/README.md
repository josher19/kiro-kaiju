# Run with headed browser
npm run test:e2e:headed
```

### CI Debugging

- Check GitHub Actions artifacts for screenshots
- Review test reports in HTML format
- Examine console logs in test output
- Use trace viewer for detailed debugging

## Test Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in appropriate category
2. Use `TestHelpers` class for common operations
3. Follow existing naming conventions
4. Add performance monitoring where appropriate
5. Include accessibility checks
6. Update this README with new test coverage

### Updating Tests

1. Keep tests in sync with UI changes
2. Update selectors when components change
3. Adjust performance thresholds as needed
4. Maintain mock data relevance
5. Update browser compatibility as needed

## Known Limitations

- Tests require development server to be running
- Some tests may be flaky on slower CI environments
- Mobile gesture testing is limited by Playwright capabilities
- Performance thresholds may need adjustment based on hardware

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Timeout errors**: Increase timeout values or check server startup
2. **Selector not found**: Verify component test IDs are present
3. **Performance failures**: Check if thresholds need adjustment
4. **Browser compatibility**: Ensure all browsers are installed

### Getting Help

- Check Playwright documentation: https://playwright.dev/
- Review test helper utilities in `helpers/test-helpers.ts`
- Examine existing test patterns for guidance
