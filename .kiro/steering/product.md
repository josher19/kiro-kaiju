# Product Overview

Kiro Kaiji: Refactor Rampage is an award-winning educational web application that gamifies code refactoring and feature development skills. The app presents users with deliberately problematic code challenges themed around programming "Kaiju" monsters, where each monster represents a specific coding anti-pattern.

## Core Concept
- Users face coding challenges with different Kaiju monsters (HydraBug, Complexasaur, Duplicatron, Spaghettizilla, Memoryleak-odactyl)
- Each monster represents specific code problems (bugs, complexity, duplication, spaghetti code, memory leaks)
- Users refactor code, add features, and get help from AI assistance and quirky virtual team members
- Progress tracking with achievements and difficulty unlocking

## Key Features
- Challenge selection by language, framework, category, and difficulty
- Integrated Kiro AI assistance for refactoring and testing
- "Zoom-a-Friend" feature with animal-themed team role avatars (QA Pufferfish, Architect Owl, Product Owner Pig, Senior Developer Cat)
- Automated evaluation on readability, quality, defects, and requirements
- Mobile-responsive design for coding on any device
- Progress tracking with achievements and unlockable content

## Target Users
Developers learning refactoring skills and best practices through gamified challenges.
